# Commercial Scenario Plan (Desktop)

This plan is the human-readable companion of `frontend/reports/commercial_scenario_lock.json`.

Goal: validate that OctopusOS Desktop can be used on a real project with a productized UX
(Claude Cowork style: modes + project + ops), while staying fully backed by OctopusOS runtime APIs.

## Buckets

1. `commercial/product_shell_navigation`
   - Product Shell tabs load embedded Console reliably.

2. `commercial/aws_ops`
   - AWS Ops entry is usable: profiles + region policy + chat handoff.

3. `commercial/projects`
   - Projects list works in embedded Console; write flows gated properly.

4. `commercial/task_replay_evidence`
   - Product task evidence/replay is solid and downloadable.
