# Backend Validation Plan (Desktop)

This plan is the human-readable companion of `frontend/reports/backend_validation_lock.json`.

## Task Buckets

1. `aws_mcp`
   - Goal: Confirm AWS MCP workflows are real and usable (profiles discovery, region policy, cost explain, ops commands).
   - Expected evidence: actual API responses and error messages, not assumptions.

2. `product_api`
   - Goal: Product Shell API endpoints are stable and produce evidence bundles for tasks.
