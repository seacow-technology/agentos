description: Operations assistant with governance demonstration

# This is a reference implementation of Execution Trust.
# It exists to prove governance works, not to be a feature-complete ops tool.

# Extremely conservative declarations
declared_actions:
  - read       # Query status
  - request    # Request operations
  - observe    # Display results

# Explicit boundaries
max_trust_tier: MEDIUM
sandbox_required: false  # But can be forced by Policy

# Permission declarations
permissions:
  - context.read
  - extensions.read
  - governance.read
  - context.refresh.request  # Only REQUEST, not execute

# Security constraints
constraints:
  cannot_decide_execution: true
  cannot_cache_authorization: true
  cannot_bypass_policy: true

# Risk profile
risk_indicators:
  - type: read_only_queries
    impact: LOW
  - type: context_refresh_request
    impact: MEDIUM
  - type: extension_execution_request
    impact: HIGH

# Expected behavior
expected_failures:
  - HIGH risk operations should be DENIED or REQUIRE_APPROVAL
  - MEDIUM risk operations should be policy-evaluated
  - All denials should have clear explanations

# Design principle
design_principle: |
  Ops Assistant must "fail gracefully and often".
  When denied, it explains WHY, not how to bypass.
  It demonstrates that governance is a fact, not a suggestion.
