  rules:
    - condition: "trust_tier == 'T0'"
      condition_type: "expression"
      action: "DENY"
      rationale: "Untrusted agents (T0) cannot perform any operations without explicit override"
      priority: 5

    - condition: "trust_tier == 'T1' and operation in ['write', 'delete', 'execute']"
      condition_type: "expression"
      action: "DENY"
      rationale: "Limited trust agents (T1) can only read, not modify"
      priority: 10

    - condition: "trust_tier == 'T2' and capability_risk_level in ['HIGH', 'CRITICAL']"
      condition_type: "expression"
      action: "ESCALATE"
      rationale: "Basic trust agents (T2) need approval for high-risk operations"
      priority: 15

    - condition: "agent_id.startswith('test_') and capability_domain == 'action'"
      condition_type: "expression"
      action: "WARN"
      rationale: "Test agents performing actions - ensure sandbox isolation"
      priority: 20
